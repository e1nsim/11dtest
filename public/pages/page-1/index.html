            <p>The website is an interactive experience based on the book "In Praise of Shadows" by Junichiro Tanizaki. The website
                features a floor plan of the house described in the book. Users must use a light cursor to explore the rooms and find hidden buttons
                that reveal each section of the book's text. 
<br>
                To navigate the floor plan, users move a light cursor around the screen. The cursor emphasizes the
                importance of light and shadow in the book and adds an immersive and engaging element to the user
                experience. As users move the cursor over different areas of the floor plan, they must carefully search
                for hidden buttons that are hidden by the dark. Once a button is found and clicked, a
                section of the book's text is revealed.</p>
