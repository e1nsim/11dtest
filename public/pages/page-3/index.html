            <p>This website is a comprehensive guide to public park toilets located in the different boroughs of New
                York City. The homepage is designed to resemble a map of the city, with circles representing each
                borough placed in their relative location. The circles also reflect the sizes of the boroughs in
                relation to each other. When visitors click on each circle, they are taken to a page that lists the public park toilets
                available in that borough. The list is organized into a chart that includes the name of each park, its
                location, and the number of toilets available. Visitors can easily search for toilets in their area or
                explore different neighborhoods and parks.</p>
